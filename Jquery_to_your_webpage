welcome..back..
Now follow these steps..
1.create a folder on your desktop with name as jqueryone(or any other)
2.Then create  a sub folder and add the downloaded jquery file to the subfile(js)
3.use any text editor(brackets,sublimetext,dreambuilder,notepad..etc) create a html file as file1.hmtl.

note:*save the file name with extensions

Congrats..you have now reached to the next stage..
As you have saved the jquery file to the desktop..we will now link our jquery file to html file(file1.html)
