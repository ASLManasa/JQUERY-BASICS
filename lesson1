Welcome back!!
We will write some scripting code here..
Let us understand using an example of pseudo code:
$("document").ready(function(){
               $("body").append("<h1>This is Jquery<\h1>");
           });


-> "$" symbol is used for refernece here.
-> document is because we are seleting the whole document. we can even select a part but we will see it further.
->ready is a function that means when the file is saved execute this function given in the bracket.
-> again we using $ symbol and write as append that means we append this to the original file.

NOTE:
* DONT FORGET ";" AFTER THE SCRIPT WRITTEN

create a file2.html and add this script and observe the output.

OBSERAVATION:The same Code above will take lot of time and code in javascript
