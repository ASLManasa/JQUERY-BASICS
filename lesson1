Welcome back!!
We will write some scripting code here..
Let us understand using an example of pseudo code:


                                $("document").ready(function(){
                                $("body").append("<h1>This is Jquery<\h1>");
                                });


-> "$" symbol is used for referenece here.
-> document is because we are selecting the whole document. we can even select a part but we will see it further.
->ready is a function that means when the file is saved execute this function given in the bracket.
-> again we using $ symbol and write as append that means we append this to the original file.

NOTE:
* DONT FORGET ";" AFTER THE SCRIPT WRITTEN

create a file2.html and add this script and observe the output.

OBSERAVATION:The same Code above will take lot of time and code in javascript
--------------------------------------------------------------

NOW WE WILL SEE ABOUT FILTERS AND SELECTORS ..

SELECTORS------------
 example:
              $("h1").css("border","1px solid");

if we understand we have given css for h1 and given properties for the heading.
use the file3.html for reference.

NOTE: WE HAVE TO GIVE FEATURE AND PROPERTY IN SEPERATE DOUBLE QUOTES.
---------------------------------------------------
FILTERS--------
          $("h1:first").css("border","1px solid");

  if we have more than one h1 or any other tag we can filter it.

  Try it yourself  execute for 4 headings..
