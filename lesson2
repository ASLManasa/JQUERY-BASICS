Welcome back.....
We will learn about replacing the code.
Example code:
            var text=$("<p>");
            text.append("<i>Replaced<\i>");
            $("#textbox").html(text);

  EXPLANATION:
  1)var is used from css. i have declared text as a variable assigned to jquery reference.
  2)I have appended the var with some data.
  3)Ihave referenced the <div> tag's id as textbox and appended it with the variable.

  look at file4.html for better understanding.
  ----------------------------
  We will deal with HANDLING EVENTS..

EXAMPLE:
          $("#textbox").on("click",whenMouseIsClicked);
               $("#textbox").on("mouseleave",whenMouseLeaves);

               function whenMouseIsClicked(){
                   $("#textbox").html("<h3>HEY!!,YOU CLICKED ME<\h3>");
               }
               function whenMouseLeaves()
               {
                  $("#textbox").html("<h3>HEY!!,YOU LEFT ME<\h3>");
               }

EXPLANATION:
1) I have created jquery reference as when click and the function is named as "whenMouseIsClicked".
similarly for when mouse leaves as function "whenMouseLeaves".
2) I have written the function for both the functions using jquery.

try yourself.(refer file5.html)
