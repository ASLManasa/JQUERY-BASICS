Welcome back.....
We will learn about replacing the code.
Example code:
            var text=$("<p>");
            text.append("<i>Replaced<\i>");
            $("#textbox").html(text);

  EXPLANATION:
  1)var is used from css. i have declared text as a variable assigned to jquery reference.
  2)I have appended the var with some data.
  3)Ihave referenced the <div> tag's id as textbox and appended it with the variable.

  look at file4.html for better understanding.
