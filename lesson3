Welcome back...
We will move further with jquery..
 Example:
            $("#show").on("click",showfun);
                $("#hide").on("click",hidefun);
                function showfun()
               {
                   $("#textbox").show();
               }
               function hidefun()
               {
                   $("#textbox").hide();
               }

  Explanation:
  1) we have linked the jquery to the js and declared the function as showfun and hide hidefun.
  2)I have written the function defination for both the function. (declared in the body of the code.)

  try the code (refer file6.html)
  -------------------
  We will write jquery code for hover effect

  Example:
      $(".textcopy").hover(highlight);
           function highlight()
           {
               $(this).toggleClass("highlight");
           }

Explanation:
1)created a selector as textcopy in the body tag and hover it with the function name as highlight.
2)I have defined the function highlight.
3)i have used $this that means pointing to the cuurent value.toogle class and defined the function.

TOGGLE CLASS: The toggleClass() method toggles between adding and removing one or more class names from the selected elements.
