FADING EFFECT

EXAMPLE:
    $("document").ready(function(){
        $("#fadein").on("click",fadein);
         $("#fadeout").on("click",fadeout);
         function fadein()
         {
             $("#textbox").fadeIn("fast",function()
             {
                 alert("I am done fadingfor 3 sec");
             });
         }
        function fadeout()
         {
             $("#textbox").fadeOut(3000,function()
             {
                 alert("I am faded for 3 sec");
             });
         }

Explanation:
1)created two selector with name fadein and fadeout with respect to diffrent functions.
2)I started declaring the function defination and declared a nested function to alert when fading is done.
3)In the 1st function declartion i declared a builin function fast as to fade in instantly.
4)In the 2nd function declartion I have given as 3000(millisec) that is 3sec and an built-in alert function.
5)fadeIn and fadeOut are also builtin function.

Try to execute it and understand.
